		 <h1>Leading Up To Base Camp</h1>
    			<p>Moving around as a child thankfully did not crush my determination to become a software developer, which has been my hope since I was 11. Really anything to do with computers has been what I've wanted to do.

      <p>
          Before Base Camp I attended college at Itawamba Community College and took a few training courses in Visual Basic, Html and CSS, as well as learned the foundation and working parts of any computer in my IT Foundations course. I managed to snag a work study during college to help me get the feel of a work environment. I didn't want to sit on my hands, I wanted to go ahead and experience what I am going to be doing for the rest of my life. All of this has helped me learn quicker and more efficiently when I came to Base Camp.

	 <div class="me-container">
      		<p> Seeing as I have started Base Camp, I am now proficient in Python, HTML and CSS, Django, as well as Visual Basic. I cannot wait to learn more languages as well. I am still attending Base Camp, and will learn Bootstrap, Javascript, and Java. </p>

      <p> I soon hope to obtain an internship from a company that will further help me develop my skills and allow me to improve and better help the company.  </p>
