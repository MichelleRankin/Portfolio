    <p>I was born on July 3rd, 2002. Growing up I moved around with my family a lot. We have finally settled down in Baldwyn, MS, and then I moved out to go to BaseCamp Coding Academy to follow my dreams. I've wanted to be a computer programmer or software developer (really anything to do with computers) since I was 11 years old. 
		 </p></div>
      <p class="me-container">
          Before Base Camp I attended college at Itawamba Community College and took a few training courses in Visual Basic, Html and CSS, as well as learned the foundation and working parts of any computer in my IT Foundations course. I managed to snag a work study during college to help me get the feel of a work environment. I didn't want to sit on my hands, I wanted to go ahead and experience what I am going to be doing for the rest of my life. All of this has helped me learn quicker and more efficiently when I came to Base Camp. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="me-container"> Seeing as I have started Base Camp, I am now proficient in Python, HTML and CSS, Django, as well as Visual Basic. I cannot wait to learn more languages as well. I am still attending Base Camp, and will learn Bootstrap, Javascript, and Java. </p>
      <p class="me-container"> I soon hope to obtain an internship from a company that will further help me develop my skills and allow me to improve and better help the company.  </p>
